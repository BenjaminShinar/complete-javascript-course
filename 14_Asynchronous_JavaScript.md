## Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises, Async/Await, and AJAX

<summary>
//fix me!
</summary>

Asynchronous JavaScript deals with long running tasks that run in the background, most commonly: fetching data from remote servers (ajax calls).

[List of public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

> **CORS** - Cross Origin Resource Sharing.
> we need Cors if we want to use the api from code.

### Asynchronous JavaScript: AJAX and APIs

<details>
<summary>
Asynchronous and synchronous code.
</summary>

most of what we wrote so far was synchronous code. executed line by line via the _'execution thread'_ (part of the execution context). each line of code waits for the previous one to complete.

synchronous code

```js
const p = document.querySelector(".p");
p.textContent = "my name is beny";
alert("Text Set!"); //blocking!
console.log("console!");
p.style.color = "red";
```

until we press the 'ok' on the alert, the next line doesn't run. if we had a timer that waits from some time, this would be very annoying. Asynchronous code is designed to go around this.
in this example we set a timeout with a callback function, the line after the setTimeout function runs before the code inside it. we register the callback and move to the next line.

```js
const p = document.querySelector(".p");
setTimeout(function () {
  p.textContent = "my name is beny"; //this is async code
}, 5000);
p.style.color = "red";
```

> Asynchronous code is executed **after a task that runs in the "background" finishes**.

the callback is deferred to the future. Asynchronous programing is coordinating the behavior of a program over time.
just because a method uses a callback function doesn't mean its asynchronous, the Array _.map()_ takes a callback and it sure as hell ain't asynchronous.

in this example, the first line is synchronous code, but the second is actually asynchronous. setting the img 'src' attribute was implemented as an asynchronous method so that it won't block (even if the img takes a long time to load), this is why the event will fire.

```js
const img = document.querySelector(".dog");
img.src = "dog.jpg"; // actually asynchronous code
img.addEventListener("load", function () {
  img.classList.add("fadeIn"); //callback function
});
p.style.width = "300px";
```

event listeners alone aren't necessary asynchronous. an event listener for 'click' isn't performing any background work.

> AJAX: **Asynchronous JavaScript And XML**.
> Allows us to communicate with remote wev servers in an **asynchronous way**. With AJAX calls, we can **request data** from web servers dynamically.

we can get data without having to refresh our page.

the client performs an http request to the server, and the server will send a response. the server contains a 'web API'.

> - API: **Application Programming Interface**.
>   Piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow **applications to talk to each other**.
> - There are many types of API's in web Development, like the **DOM API**, **Geolocation API**, and even our classes can have API, and what we currently are interested in are **Online API**.
> - Online API: application running on a server, that receives requests for data, and sends data back as response.
>
> * We can build our own web api (with backend development, like node.js), or use a 3rd-party API.

there is probably an API for anything: weather,flights, currency exchange rates, maps, sending email, getting data about countries... anything we want!

the X in AJAX stands for XML, but today nobody uses xml for requests and responses, we use the JSON format instead.

#### Our First AJAX Call

<details>
<summary>
Using XMLHttpRequest object to perform Ajax calls with event listeners. 
</summary>

A UI component that gets data about countries from an online API.
there are multiple ways to do ajax calls, but we start with the most basic one, it's 'old-school' and not used like this anymore, instead we have promises.

we start by taking the _Rest Countries_ API from the public api list on github. we look for an endpoint URL. we then register a callback on the request.

```js
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
const url = "https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/";
request.open("GET", url + "portugal");
request.send();
request.addEventListener("load", function () {
  //the 'this' the the request.
  console.log(this.responseText);
  const [data] = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
  console.log(data);
});
```

once we get the data, we can build a html card from it.

```html
<article class="country">
  <img class="country__img" src="" />
  <div class="country__data">
    <h3 class="country__name">COUNTRY</h3>
    <h4 class="country__region">REGION</h4>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üë´</span>POP people</p>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üó£Ô∏è</span>LANG</p>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üí∞</span>CUR</p>
  </div>
</article>
```

we use a string template as usual. and we refactor away whatever parts we can into different functions. we have two ajax calls at the same time, so the order might change in each time.

if we cared about the order, we would need to chain the request, only send one request after the earlier was completed, which can lead to _'callback hell'_

</details>

#### Welcome to Callback Hell

<details>
<summary>
Callback Hell: making new requests based on responses, and setting many levels of nesting
</summary>

We saw that requests can arrive at different order, let's try and make them happen in sequences.
using the data we got from the countries api, we can request for one country and then find it's neighboring countries.
when the first AJAX call is done, we will take the data from "borders" property, and use it. because it gives us a country code and not a country name, we need a different url endpoint to work with.

in the code endpoint api, the result is a single object, and not an array. ain't that wonderful.

so far, we have only one nested callback, but if we had more it would have horrible, if we wanted to take the neighbor of the neighbor of the neighbor. we would need to nest many callbacks. this is **Callback hell**, and can happen whenever the request is based on the results of a previous response.

here is callback hell with timeouts

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("1 second passed!");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("2 second passed!");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("3 second passed!");
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("4 second passed!");
      }, 1000);
    }, 1000);
  }, 1000);
}, 1000);
```

this is hard to read, hard to understand and will have more bugs. if we want to solve this we need something else.

</details>

</details>

### How the Web Works: Request and Responses

<details>
<summary>
Optional Content: what happens when we access a website.
</summary>

when we access a web server, the client (the browser) sends a requests, and the server (website) sends a response. this is called a
**request-response model** or **client-sever architecture**.

using the url from earlier:

> https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/code

we can divide it into parts:
protocol: "http" (or https,or others!)
domain name: "restcountries.eu"
resource: "/rest/v2/alpha/code"

the domain name is just a nice name for us to read, the real address is provided by DNS.
DNS stands for _domain name server_, which is a server that knows how to match a string address from the domain into a real ip address. the io address is a number and a port (port 443 is default for https, 80 for http)

a tcp/ip socket connection is created between the client and the server. the request is an http request, a protocol for communication based around resources.

the request has a

- StartLine
- Header
- Body (for posting data)

the target of the http request is what we called 'resource', if we don't specify the resource, we simply access the root of the website.

the main difference between http and https is that the https protocol is encrypted by some protocol.

once the request is processed, the server sends an http response. the http response is similar to the request, also containing a StartLine, header and a body, but it also has a status code and status message.

the headers are information about the response, and the body contains the json data or the html data or whatever.

in the 1st response, we can the html file. the html file contains all the knowledge of how to get everything we need, like images, JavaScript stuff,css, etc...

TCP/IP breaks the data into small packets and then reassembles them, each packet takes a different route through the internet, the tcp/ip then rebuilds the data.

</details>

### Promises

<details>
<summary>
A promise is a container that will hold the result of an asynchronous operation.
</summary>

[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

ES6 introduces provided a 'promise' object, which is supposed to stop the callback hell issue.

- _fetch(url)_ - create a promise.
- _.then(func, func)_ - what to do with the result, implicitly creates another promise.
- _.catch(func)_ - handle rejected promises.
- _.finally(func)_ - will always be called, no matter if successful or not.
- throw(error) - throw an error objects, this will be caught and reject the promise.
- _Promise.resolve()_ - a resolved promise object.
- _Promise.reject()_ - a rejected promise object.

#### The Fetch Api

<details>
<summary>
fetch is a short hand way to create a promise.
</summary>

we now have fetch and promises.

```js
const request = fetch("https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/turkey");
console.log(request);
```

> - **Promise**: an object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.
> - **Promise**: a container for an asynchronously delivered value.
> - **Promise**: a container for a future value.

the promise stores the future value of the ajax request.

> We no longer need to rely on event and callbacks passed into asynchronous functions to handle asynchronous results.
> Instead of nesting callbacks, we can **chain promises** for a sequence of asynchronous operations, therefore **escaping callback hell**.

the promise objects are time sensitive, they have lifecycle and can be in a different state.

- pending
- settled
  - fulfilled
  - rejected

we handle the different states. a promise is only settled once, it cannot revert back.
getting a result is called 'consuming it', the fetch API builds the promise for us.

</details>

#### Consuming Promises

<details>
<summary>
Calling .then() on the promise object to determine how it behaves once is settled/
</summary>

Consuming a promise means using it. we create it with a fetch.
we pass the callback function into the '_.then()_' method. this callback gets the response from the server. we can also pass a callback function to handle bad responses.

the data is in the response body, in a 'readable stream' object. we need to read it, with _.json()_ which is also an asynchronous function that returns a promise, so we need another call to _.then()_, this time the data is available.

```js
fetch("https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/turkey")
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function (data) {
    console.log(data);
  });

fetch("https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/canada")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

so we need at least 2 calls to Then for each fetch. this makes the code easier to read. promises don't remove callback functions, but they reduce callback hell.

</details>

#### Chaining Promises

<details>
<summary>
rather then nested callbacks, we can use a flat chain of promises,
</summary>

earlier, we had code to get the country and it's neighbors, lets do it with promises. rather then nest, we pull out the promise object into the external chain.

then _.then()_ method always returns a promise,
what we explicitly return is just what we want the promise to resolve into.

```js
fetch("https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/turkey")
  .then((response) => 23)
  .then((r) => console.log(r)); //23
```

a common mistake is to insert the _.then()_ method inside the nested earlier _.then()_, rather than returning the promise object and handling it at the same level of the chain.

</details>

#### Handling Rejected Promises

<details>
<summary>
handling rejected promises - .catch(), finally().
</summary>
so far, we worked under the assumption that our ajax calls resolve successfully, this isn't always true.
the fetch promise can only be rejected when the user loses the internet connection, 
we can simulate this by opening the network tab in the browser and changing the 'throttling' to offline. but for our purposes, we want to first load the page, close the connection and then send the request, we do this by adding a button that sends the request.

**this didn't work for me until i disabled the cache**

we have an uncaught rejection in the promise.
we can handle rejection by adding a 2nd callback function to the _.then()_ function.

```js
fetch("https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/turkey")
  .then(
    (response) => response.json(),
    (err) => alert(err) //error callback
  )
  .then((r) => console.log(r));
```

but this means we need to add an error handler callback inside each _.then()_, we can avoid this by having a _.catch()_ method at the end of the chain, this will handle all error in the chain.

```js
fetch("https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/turkey")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((r) => console.log(r))
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

let's also create a function to render an error

```js
const renderError = function (msg) {
  countriesContainer.insertAdjacentText("beforeend", msg);
  countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
};
```

the error is a real JS object. all errors have _.message_ property. we will go into this

one last method of promises is _.finally()_ which takes a callback, and is executed no matter what (success or reject), we wll use it to fade in the container (which we always do)

```js
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  fetch("https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/turkey")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => createCard(data[0]))
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log(`got error! console ${err.message}`);
      renderError(err.message);
    })
    .finally(() => (countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1));
});
```

our final case is when the api finishes, but that we didn't get what we want. this is not a reject, a 404 status code is still a fulfilled promise for the fetch.

</details>

#### Throwing Errors Manually

<details>
<summary>
creating errors, throwing them. identifying them.
</summary>

[The Error object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) and [Throwing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw)

this time, we will fix the issue of getting a 404 status code in our promise. we can look at our response object, it has a _.ok_ property which is boolean, and a _.statusCode_, which is a number, we can check this ourself and create a manual error.

this is done by using an Error object. which we need to throw with the _throw_, which rejects the promise, this propagates upwards until the _.catch()_ clause.

```js
const getCountryWithPromiseAndErrorsStatusCode = function (country) {
  fetch(`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`)
    .then((response) => {
      console.log(response);
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`country not found! ${response.status}`);
      }
      return response.json();
    })
    .then((data) => createCard(data[0]))
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(`got error! console ${err.message}`);
      renderError(err.message);
    })
    .finally(() => (countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1));
};
```

but we can have an error in each of those callbacks, what do we do? do we copy then error handling into each of the functions?

lets make ourself an utility function,

```js
const getJson = function (url, errorMsg = "Something Went Wrong") {
  return fetch(url).then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`${errorMsg} - ${response.status} error!`);
    }
    return response.json();
  });
};
```

but when there is no neighbors, we return, but then we get an error.we can see this in action if we try using australia. we can instead make our own error message for this case.

```js
const getCountryWithPromiseAndErrorsStatusCode2 = function (country) {
  getJson(
    `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/${country}`,
    "Country not found!"
  )
    .then((data) => {
      createCard(data[0]);
      const neighbor = data[0].borders[0];
      if (!neighbor) throw new Error("no neighbors!");
      return getJson(URLS.code + neighbor);
    })
    .then((data) => createCard(data, "neighbour"))
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(`got error! ${err.message}`);
      renderError(err.message);
    })
    .finally(() => (countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1));
};
```

> In this challenge you will build a function 'whereAmI' which renders a country only based on GPS coordinates. For that, you will use a second API to geocode coordinates. So in this challenge, you‚Äôll use an API on your own for the first time.
> Your tasks:
>
> PART 1
>
> 1. Create a function 'whereAmI' which takes as inputs a latitude value ('lat') and a longitude value ('lng') (these are GPS coordinates, examples are in test data below).
> 2. Do ‚Äúreverse geocoding‚Äù of the provided coordinates. Reverse geocoding means to convert coordinates to a meaningful location, like a city and country name. Use this API to do reverse geocoding: https://geocode.xyz/api. The AJAX call will be done to a URL with this format:https://geocode.xyz/52.508,13.381?geoit=json. Use the fetch API and promises to get the data. Do not use the 'getJSON' function we created, that is cheating.
> 3. Once you have the data, take a look at it in the console to see all the attributes that you received about the provided location. Then, using this data, log a message like this to the console: ‚ÄúYou are in Berlin, Germany‚Äù.
> 4. Chain a .catch method to the end of the promise chain and log errors to the console.
> 5. This API allows you to make only 3 requests per second. If you reload fast, you will get this error with code 403. This is an error with the request. Remember, fetch() does not reject the promise in this case. So create an error to reject the promise yourself, with a meaningful error message
>
> PART 2
>
> 6. Now it's time to use the received data to render a country. So take the relevant attribute from the geocoding API result, and plug it into the countries API that we have been using.

### Behind the Scenes: The Event Loop

<details>
<summary>
Better understanding of the event loop. the callback queue and the micro tasks queue.
</summary>

let's review the JavaScript runtime again
an JavaScript engine with heap and call stack, web Apis, event Loop with callback queue.

JavaScript only has one thread of execution, there is no multi-threading.

once the call stack is empty (except for the _global execution context_), the event loop takes elements from the callback queue and pushes them onto the call stack.

> Concurrency Model: how JavaScript handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.

so how does asynchronous code executes in a non blocking way with only one thread of execution?

```js
const el =document.querySelector('img');
el.src ='dog.jpg';
el.addEventListener('load',()=> el.classList.add('fadeIn'));

fetch('https://someurl.com/api')
.then(res=> console.log(res);)
```

the webAPI have their own runtime environment, it's not in the JavaScript call stack, registering an event lister is actually something that we do to the webAPI environment.
when the image finishes loading,the event is emitted, and the webAPI pushes the callback function to the callback queue. for timers, there can be a delay, depending on how much work there is to do between the time the the event was emitted and the callback function pushed onto the callback queue, and when it was finally picked up by the event loop to be run in the call stack. Dom events aren't necessarily asynchronous, but they still use the callback queue.

each time the call stack is empty (except for the global execution context), the event loop 'ticks' and pushes a callback from the callback queue onto the stack.

JavaScript doesn't have any concept of time, all asynchronous behavior comes from the webAPIs together with the event loop.

promises work in a slightly different way, they don't go into the callback queue, they have a special queue just for themselves, it's called 'micro-tasks queue' which has **priority** over the callback queue. the micro task queue can keep pushing onto itself, and therefore starve the callback queue. this is bad.

there are also microTasks from objects other than promises, but that's for another time.

#### The Event Loop in Practice

<details>
<summary>
Showing the order of execution.
</summary>

let's see this in our code. first, we can see that the micro-tasks queue has priority over the callback queue. and of course, the global context has to finish it's first one before the event loop 'tick'

we use the _Promise.Resolve()_ to demonstrate this:

```js
console.log("test event loop start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("0 sec timer"), 0); //call after zero seconds, push into the callback queue
Promise.resolve("resolved promise!").then((d) => console.log(d)); //pushed into the micro-task queue.
console.log("test end");
```

> - test start
> - test end
> - _event loop tick_
> - resolved promise
> - _event loop tick_
> - 0 sec timer
> - _event loop tick_

now lets show that a timer waits for the promise to finish. even if we say zero seconds, it is delayed until the promise ends.

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log("0 sec timer2"), 0);

Promise.resolve("resolved 2").then((res) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10 ** 7; ++i) {
    //waste time
  }
  console.log(res);
});
```

</details>

</details>

### Building A Simple Promise

<details>
<summary>
Using promises instead of callbacks.
</summary>

let's build our own promise, based on the lottery ticket example.
the Promise constructor takes a function, called an executor function, this function has resolve and reject as arguments. what we pass to the 'resolve' function is the argument that will be passed to the _.then()_ callback function, and the 'reject' will be passed to the _.catch()_ clause, or the 2nd callback function of the _.then()_.

```js
const lotteryPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    resolve("The promise was resolved! you won!");
  } else {
    reject("The promise was rejected! you lost!");
  }
});
lotteryPromise.then((x) => console.log(x)).catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

if we want to make this asynchorunse, we need to add a timeout,

```js
function ourOwnPromise() {
  const lotteryPromise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
        resolve("The promise was resolved! you won!");
      } else {
        reject("The promise was rejected! you lost!");
      }
    }, 1500);
  });
  lotteryPromise.then((x) => console.log(x)).catch((err) => console.error(err));
}
```

in real life, we usually just consume promises, at most we can wrap callback function into promise objects, something called 'promisifing'.

```js
const wait = function (seconds) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve) {
    setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000);
  });
};

wait(5)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("I waited 5 seconds");
    return wait(2);
  })
  .then(() => console.log("I waited for 2 seconds"));
```

so instead of the earlier nested set timeout form before, we can use our promisified chain.

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("1 second passed!");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("2 second passed!");
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("3 second passed!");
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("4 second passed!");
      }, 1000);
    }, 1000);
  }, 1000);
}, 1000);
```

is changed into this, which looks slightly better?

```js
wait(1)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("1 second passed");
    return wait(1);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("2 second passed");
    return wait(1);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("3 second passed");
    return wait(1);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("4 second passed");
    return wait(1);
  });
```

if we want fullfilled or a rejected promise, we can static methods

```js
Promise.resolve("abc");
Promise.reject("dsa");
```

#### Promisifying the Geo-location API

<details>
<summary>
changing our previous work to something else.
</summary>

let's promisify our geo-location api from the mapity project..
we used callbacks

```js
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  (position) => console.log(position),
  (err) => console.error(err)
);
```

now we move to promises.

```js
const promisifiedGeoLocation = function () {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject);
  });
};
promisifiedGeoLocation().then((res) => console.log(res));
```

and lets advance our 'whereAmI' method from the challenge. the result of calling 'fetch()' is a promise.

object destructuring. renaming latitude to lat,

```js
const { latitude: lat, longitude: lng } = res.coords;
```

> 1. Write an async function 'loadNPause' that recreates Challenge #2, this time using async/await (only the part where the promise is consumed, reuse the 'createImage' function from before).
> 2. Compare the two versions, think about the big differences, and see which one you like more?
> 3. Don't forget to test the error handler, and to set the network speed to ‚ÄúFast 3G‚Äù in the dev tools Network tab
>
> PART 2
>
> 1. Create an async function 'loadAll' that receives an array of image paths 'imgArr'.
> 2. Use .map to loop over the array, to load all the images with the 'createImage' function (call the resulting array 'imgs').
> 3. Check out the 'imgs' array in the console! Is it like you expected?
> 4. Use a promise combinator function to actually get the images from the array.
> 5. Add the 'parallel' class to all the images (it has some CSS styles).
>
> Test data Part 2:
> ['img/img-1.jpg', 'img/img-2.jpg', 'img/img-3.jpg'].
>
> To test, turn off the 'loadNPause' function.
